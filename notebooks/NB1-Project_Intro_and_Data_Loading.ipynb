    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The restaurant industry in the United States generated \\\\$833.1 billion in revenue in 2018 and was projected to reach $863 billion in 2019 [1]. Restaurants reviews and ratings on popular review websites are important factors in attracting new customers. Yelp is one of the most popular review websites, including over 135 million restaurant and business reviews and over 90 million users visiting the website per month. A study found that a one star increase in a Yelp rating leads to a 5% - 9% increase in revenue for a restaurant [2]. This underlines the financial importance of Yelp ratings on restaurants."

    "## Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to help aspiring restaurant owners understand the ratings their planned restaurant might get on a review website, given the amenities they plan to include, and feedback received from soft openings. By using a combination of numerical, categorical, and text data, we utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to build a regression model that can predict the rating of a restaurant assigned by a customer. This will give restauranteurs an advanced awareness of customers’ sentiment towards the restaurants, allowing them to make any changes prior to opening to avoid receiving low ratings once in operation."

    "## Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project was acquired from the Yelp Open Dataset [3], which is published by Yelp on its [website](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) for educational and non-commercial purposes. It consists of a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data. The entire dataset is divided among separate JSON files, namely:\n",
    "- Business dataset, which contains information about each business including ID, name, address, category, attributes and operating hours\n",
    "- Reviews dataset, which contains reviews by Yelp users on different businesses\n",
    "- User dataset, which contains information about the Yelp activity of each user\n",
    "- Tips dataset, which contains tips on different businesses\n",
    "- Check-ins dataset, which contains the timestamps for each time a Yelp user checks in at a business\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will only utilize the business and review datasets."

    "## Supplementary Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional data sources were researched in the early stages of the project to gain information about restaurant menu items, since this information is not included in the Yelp dataset. The only source found with this information was [Documenu API](https://documenu.com/) which claims to provide access to over 600,000 US restaurant menus with over 40 million individual menu items. However, after trialling this service, it was found that the service limited  menu query results to a maximum of 25 restaurants per API call, with some restaurants returning missing menu information. In addition, the service limits the user to just 25 API calls per month before introducing paid tiers to increase the number of API calls. Due to these limitations, exploring this data source was abandoned early in the project due to the unknown value that this information would bring. Given more time, budget, and also foresight about what the size of the final filtered dataset for this project would look like, it would have been interesting to supplement our main data source with the Documenu data."
